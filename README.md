Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, 
personalised way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized 
by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. 
These millions of listings generate a lot of data data that can be analysed and used for security, business decisions,

implementation of innovative additional services and much more.
